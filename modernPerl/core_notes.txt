MODERN PERL - notes
===================

Names / Identifiers
-------------------

  (variable names, function names, package names, etc...)

  RULES:

  1) cannot have spaces
  2) cannot start with a number
  3) cannot have symbols that are not alpha-numeric

  - note: just follow good variable naming practices.

Variable Names
--------------

  variable names in perl are always preceded by a sigil(symbol) which indicates the type of the variable's value.  There are 3 types:

  1) Scalar : my $scalar
  2) Array : my @array
  3) Hash : my %hash

  - note: it is possible to declare variables of the same name, but with different types, ex: $teams & @teams.  Perl will not get confused by this, but humans will, so it is best to avoid this in practice.

Variables
---------

  Definition: a variable is just a storage location for a value.

Variable Scope
--------------

  Ability to access a variable within perl will depend on the variable's scope.   a variable defined within the file has global scope.  a variable defined within a code block: {} is only accessible within that code block.
